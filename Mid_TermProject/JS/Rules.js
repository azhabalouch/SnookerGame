Snooker Foul Rules

    Potting the Cue Ball (White Ball):
        If the cue ball is potted into any pocket, a foul is committed.
        Penalty: The opponent is awarded 4 points and gains control of the table.
        Missing the Target Ball:

        If the cue ball fails to make contact with the intended target ball, it is a foul.
        Penalty: The opponent is awarded points equal to the value of the target ball (minimum 4 points).

        Potting the Wrong Ball:

    If a player pots a ball out of sequence (e.g., potting a colored ball when a red ball is required), a foul is committed.
    Penalty: The opponent is awarded points equal to the value of the potted ball (minimum 4 points).

    Failure to Hit the Cushion:

    After contact with the target ball, at least one ball must hit a cushion. Failure to do so constitutes a foul.
    Penalty: 4 points are awarded to the opponent.

    Hitting the Wrong Ball First:

    The cue ball must strike the correct ball as per the sequence of play (e.g., red ball when reds are active). Failure to do so is a foul.
    Penalty: The opponent is awarded points equal to the value of the target ball (minimum 4 points).

    Time Violation:

    If a player exceeds the allocated time for a shot, it is a foul.
    Penalty: The opponent gains 4 points and control of the table.

    Sequence Violations (Red and Color):

    Players must alternate potting red and colored balls. Failing to do so (e.g., potting multiple colors or reds consecutively) results in a foul.
    Penalty: Points are awarded based on the value of the wrongly potted ball (minimum 4 points).
