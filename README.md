Snooker Game â€“ Interactive Simulation Application

This project is a snooker game that uses p5.js to draw the table, Matter.js to simulate realistic physics, and p5.sound to add audio effects.

**Project Overview**  
- **Drawing and Setup:**  
  The game uses p5.js to create the snooker table, cue, and balls for a smooth visual experience.

- **Physics Simulation:**  
  Matter.js handles ball collisions, movement, and friction to make the game feel real.

- **Audio Effects:**  
  p5.sound adds sounds like ball hits, cue strikes, and other game noises.

- **Controls:**  
  You can control the cue with the mouse or keyboard to aim and shoot the ball.

- **Scoring:**  
  The game updates the score in real time and keeps track of the game progress.
